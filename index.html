            <p>Humans have long modified and changed the environment around them. For example, the rise of agriculture, favoring
                and cultivating certain plants and animals over others, led to reliable food supplies. Agriculture needed reliable
            water supplies which led to the diversion of rivers and irrigation. There are untold other changes, but until relatively
            recently in human history these changes were local or regional in nature. Case in point, the level of global CO<sub>2</sub>
            emissions were minimal and fairly consistent, largely from the burning of wood and some coal. Notice the
                line indicating CO<sub>2</sub> emissions is barely discernible until roughly the 1850's. The explosion in industrialization levels
            changed all of this.</p>
            <p>Even then emission levels largely continued to be from solid fuels: coal, wood, etc. Then, notice the rise of gas fuels starting in the
            early 1900s that coincides with the rise of cheap, mass produced automobiles such as the Model-T. Emissions from
                other fuel types really took off after World War Two. Gas fuel,gas flaring  and cement production went from negligible
                to significant contributors to emissions. Surprisingly, cement production is as a major cause of
                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Cement is a vital part of a huge variety of construction activities. The primary ingredient of cement is
                limestone. The heating of limestone in the cement manufacturing process results in a significant release of CO<sub>2</sub>.
                It's also an energy intensive process that requires the burning of large amounts of coal and oil to manufacture.</p>
            <p>The result of this explosive rise in emission levels, particularly in the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, has
                led to large changes in the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Even if CO<sub>2</sub> emissions were suddenly reduced to
                zero it would still take centuries if not millennia for CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations to fall back to pre-industrial levels.
            Historically the CO<sub>2</sub> level since the rise of human civilization has been roughly about <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/">280 parts per million</a>
                in the Earth's atmosphere. They're now over 400 parts per million with a consequent rise in <a href="/temp-co-two">world temperatures</a> and
            a decline in such things as <a href="/sea-ice">world sea ice levels</a>, particularly in the arctic.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Methane Levels</h3>
                <p>Methane levels have been rising in concert with CO<sub>2</sub> levels. While not as plentiful, nor as long lasting in the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub>
                methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas, trapping <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases">25
                times more heat</a> than an equivalent amount of CO<sub>2</sub>. The rise in methane levels can be attributed to some of the
                same causes as CO<sub>2</sub>, such as natural gas production. Some large, if unusual causes of increasing methane levels
                are trash rotting in dumps and livestock flatulence, particularly from cows. All told it's taken barely 30 years to raise
                methane levels by almost 200 parts per billion in the atmosphere.</p>
